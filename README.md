# clustering


PDF file of the poster. PDFs are preferred because they avoid potential format
problems (different defaults on different systems). The poster should be uploaded
as is and not be wrapped into a zip file or similar.

## Instructions

• Your program as python file (in case there are problems with the repo). Notebooks
are depreciated.

• Do not upload data files. Worldbank files do not need to be referenced. Links to
other data suffice.

• Repositories: Repositories are mainly used to store different versions of program-
ming code. We expect repeat commits for full marks. Other material can also be
uploaded, but that is optional. Post your github link as a comment or in your
poster.
